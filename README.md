# CPU and GPU Design Trends Analysis

## OBJECTIVES
- Analyzed vendor and foundry relationships in processor production
- Investigated the association between die size and thermal design power and assessed Moore's Law prediction

## RESULTS FOUND
There isn't a strong association between the number of processors released by the vendors and the foundries. For all vendors, the composition of their foundries is mixed. For example, the processors sold by AMD come from unknown foundries, TSMC, and GF. This case applies to all vendors. For Intel, although only two processors are produced by foundries other than itself, we still can't say they are exclusively released by Intel. The lack of association does not depend on the processor type; neither the CPU nor GPU data demonstrate a clear pattern of association. Each vendor's suppliers are different foundries, and they produce in different portions.
